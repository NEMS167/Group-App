Low range status app

This app will be a low range yik yak. The level of anonymity varies with the size of the crowd you're in

When you walk by someone who has the app you get a ping (their "status/message") and that of the people they have encountered in the last |5|10|15 minutes (user defined) this can be accomplished using Bluetooth or wifi with location based
Wanna have varying levels of anonymity hold your message back up to 30min after a "ping" (or it can be randomized, the lower times having a higher priority)
Pros

Can be used in movie theaters, concerts, sporting events, parties, classrooms, campuses, stores and any other "heavily populated area"
You might even figure out who the status belongs to
If Bluetooth enable it can be used in areas with bad signal
Cons

You might figure out who the status belongs to
The feed will be boring
Everyone uses high levels of anonymity (randomize it?)
Only works if you are around people a lot so it's not a home thing unless you live in a dorm/apartment complex
Bonus

For money have locations forward messages including specials or just welcome messages
